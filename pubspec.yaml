# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

     - assets/FondoCoheteNegro.jpg
     - assets/gatonegro.jpg
     - assets/FondoCoheteNegro2.jpg
     - assets/google_logo.png
     - assets/google_logo_212.png
     - assets/animation.gif
     - assets/fonts/
     - assets/logo.jpg
     - assets/animation.json
     - assets/VideoDelLogo.mp4
     - assets/background.mp4
     - assets/fondodashboard.mp4
     - assets/videoPrincipalblanco.mp4

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
